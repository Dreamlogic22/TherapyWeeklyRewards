# Therapy Weekly Rewards

Therapy Weekly Rewards is a data broker that lets you track your weekly progress towards Great Vault rewards and Catalyst charges.  You can use it with any sort of Data Broker display (Titan Panel, Chocolate Bar, ElvUI, &c) or by using a native minimap icon Clicking on the display will open your Great Vault for viewing.

Please let me know if you have any problems setting it up or running it by reporting an issue.  Thanks!
