# Therapy Weekly Rewards

**Version 1.01** (March 12, 2023, WoW 10.0.5)

Therapy Weekly Rewards is a data broker that lets you track your weekly progress towards Great Vault rewards.  You will need a broker display addon (Titan Panel, Chocolate Bar, ElvUI, &c.) to use it.

Here's how it looks as an ElvUI DataText:

Here's how it looks running in Titan Panel:

Clicking on the display will open your Great Vault for viewing.

Please let me know if you have any problems setting it up or running it by reporting an issue.  Thanks!
